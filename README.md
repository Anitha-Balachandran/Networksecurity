# 🚀 Phishing Website Detection Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Phishing attacks pose a significant cybersecurity threat, tricking users into providing sensitive information through fraudulent websites. This project aims to develop a **machine learning-based phishing detection system** that classifies websites as **phishing (-1) or legitimate (1)** based on various URL, domain, and webpage behavior features.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains key website attributes, including:  
- **URL Features**: IP address presence, URL length, shortening service, '@' symbol, etc.  
- **Domain Features**: SSL status, domain age, registration length.  
- **HTML & JavaScript Features**: Favicon, redirects, pop-ups, iframe usage, etc.  
- **Behavioral & Ranking Features**: Google index, page rank, web traffic, DNS record.
